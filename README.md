# Description

Made with Python 3.9 and the [Python Discord API Wrapper](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

This bot focuses on the catching aspect that was developed by the original [PokéBot](https://discordbots.org/bot/330488924449275916?utm_source=widget). While it contains the similar style of catching pokemon from the original, I've added more tweaks of my own. You can hatch and exchange pokemon, and even get lootboxes containing pokemon. You can also customize the bot to have events.

To read more on the bot's features, see the [command page](https://github.com/kodycode/PokeBot-Python/wiki/Command-Page).

For information on events, see the [event page](https://github.com/kodycode/PokeBot-Python/wiki/Events).

# Installation

To setup the bot,

1. Rename config_template.json to config.json

2. Rename events_template.json to events.json

3. Enter your discord bot token into the `token` field of config.json

4. Run the bot with `python bot.py` or `python3 bot.py`

For more options for configuration, see the [config page](https://github.com/kodycode/PokeBot-Python/wiki/Config).

# Pull Requests

If you think have a feature that's worthy of being on the main branch, I'd suggest you make a pull request and explain what this feature is. I'd prefer my bot to be the way it is and for others to modify the bot however they'd like for their own server, however I'm open to having more features so long as it appeals to the scope of the bot.
